# SQL-Project-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-Tech-Response-To-Water-Vulnerability
In this project, the dataset I used was from the Climate change adaptation innovation in the water sector in Africa paper. This study looked at the response of technology to water vulnerability created by climate change in Africa. 

I calculated summary statistics and created visualizations to generate insights on water stress index levels, which accounts for things like projected change of annual runoff, projected change of annual groundwater recharge, fresh water withdrawal rate, water dependency ratio, dam capacity, and access to reliable drinking water. A higher index indicates higher vulnerability.
